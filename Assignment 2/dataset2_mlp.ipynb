    "In this part of the code, the multilayer perceptron (MLP) is defined. It consists of an input layer, four fully connected hidden layers with 64 neurons each and a final output layer. After each hidden layer, a dropout operation is applied, with a default probability of 0.5. So, during training, half of the neurons are randomly deactivated to reduce overfitting and improve the network's ability to generalize. The hidden layers of this network use the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function, which introduces non-linearity and enables the network to capture complex relationships in the data. On the other hand, the output layer has a single neuron and no activation function, leaving its interpretation and any task-specific processing to the choice of loss function. "
